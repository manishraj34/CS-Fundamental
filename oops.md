# Object Oriented Programming Interview Question
  - To solve real world probem we use OOPS

## Polymorphism 
- it is a combinaton of 2 towd Poly and morphism 
- Poly means :- many  and morphism :- forms = manyforms
- whose meaning is **Same object having different behavior**


## 1) What is oops?
- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

- Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    - OOP is faster and easier to execute
    - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    - OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
    - It lowers the overall cost of development.

## 2)How Object Oriented Programming is relates to Real world ?

- Basically why we are write coding ,to solve our real world problem right.
- In OOP a logic is right base on the object with this features
  1. abstraction
  2. encapsulation
  3. inheritance
  4. polymorphism
- There are a lot of Car,bike,ATM and coffee machine.and there brands and name also different.
In OOP those are called object .
- Objects logic are done by classes for example ,by phone we can call,Bluetooth ,take photo etc. those every logic
will be divide as classes.

## 3)Why to study OOP (OR) Why we need OOPs in Programming language?

- OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself"
- OOPs provides code reusability which reduce the duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you have make changes everywhere which leads to performance.
- Code can be changed anytime as per our requirement  in the application, OOPs makes it easier.

## 4)Disadvanteges of OOPs?
- ***Larger program size:*** Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs. 
- ***Slower programs:*** Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
- ***Not suitable for all types of problems:*** The problems like functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based
programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs. 

## 5)When we say a language is object-oriented What does it mean?

- If a language is designed with the facilities specifically to support object-oriented programming having 4 features that is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
polymorphism then it is an Object-oriented programming language.
-  It's the code that is object-oriented not the language.

## 6)What is class?

- It is a basic concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Class is a blueprint of an object.
- A class is a user defined datatype which define its properties and function.

## 7) Structure vs class

## 8) Similarity between structure and class?

- Both are container types, meaning that they contain other types as members.

- Both have members, which can include constructors, methods, properties, fields, constants, enumerations, events, and event handlers.
- Both can implement interfaces.

## 9)when to use structure over class?
- If the size of the instance is below 16 bytes.
- Structures are preferred for object design for data storage like array.
