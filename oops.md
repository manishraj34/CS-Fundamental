# Object Oriented Programming Interview Question
  - To solve real world probem we use OOPS

## Polymorphism 
- it is a combinaton of 2 towd Poly and morphism 
- Poly means :- many  and morphism :- forms = manyforms
- whose meaning is **Same object having different behavior**


## 1) What is oops?
- OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

- Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

- Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

    - OOP is faster and easier to execute
    - OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
    - OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
    - OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
    - It lowers the overall cost of development.

## 2)How Object Oriented Programming is relates to Real world ?

- Basically why we are write coding ,to solve our real world problem right.
- In OOP a logic is right base on the object with this features
  1. abstraction
  2. encapsulation
  3. inheritance
  4. polymorphism
- There are a lot of Car,bike,ATM and coffee machine.and there brands and name also different.
In OOP those are called object .
- Objects logic are done by classes for example ,by phone we can call,Bluetooth ,take photo etc. those every logic
will be divide as classes.

## 3)Why to study OOP (OR) Why we need OOPs in Programming language?

- OOP helps to keep the JAVA code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself"
- OOPs provides code reusability which reduce the duplication of code because once you have duplicate code, you have make changes everywhere which leads to performance.
- Code can be changed anytime as per our requirement  in the application, OOPs makes it easier.

## 4)Disadvanteges of OOPs?
- ***Larger program size:*** Object-oriented programs typically involve more lines of code than procedural programs. 
- ***Slower programs:*** Object-oriented programs are typically slower than procedure-based programs, as they typically require more instructions to be executed.
- ***Not suitable for all types of problems:*** The problems like functional-programming style, logic-programming style, or procedure-based
programming style, and applying object-oriented programming in those situations will not result in efficient programs. 

## 5)When we say a language is object-oriented What does it mean?

- If a language is designed with the facilities specifically to support object-oriented programming having 4 features that is abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance,
polymorphism then it is an Object-oriented programming language.
-  It's the code that is object-oriented not the language.

## 6)What is class?

- It is a basic concept of Object-Oriented Programming.
- Class is a blueprint of an object.
- A class is a user defined datatype which define its properties and function.

## 7) Structure vs class

## 8) Similarity between structure and class?

- Both are container types, meaning that they contain other types as members.

- Both have members, which can include constructors, methods, properties, fields, constants, enumerations, events, and event handlers.
- Both can implement interfaces.

## 9)when to use structure over class?
- If the size of the instance is below 16 bytes.
- Structures are preferred for object design for data storage like array.

## 10) What is Access Modifier?
- There are two types of modifiers in Java: access modifiers and non-access modifiers.
- The access modifiers in Java specifies the accessibility or scope of a field, method, constructor, or class.
- We can change the access level of fields, constructors, methods, and class by applying the access modifier on it.
1. Private: The access level of a private modifier is **only within the class**. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.
2. Default: The access level of a default modifier is **only within the package**. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you don't use any modifier, it is treated as default by default.
3. Protected: The access level of a protected modifier is **within the package and outside the package through child class**. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.
4. Public: The access level of a public modifier is **everywhere**. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.

## 11) Member Functions
- Member functions are the functions, which have their declaration inside the class definition and works on the data members of the class.
- The definition of member functions can be inside or outside the definition of class.
- If the member function is defined inside the class definition it can be defined directly, but if its defined outside the class, then we have to use the scope resolution :: operator along with class name alng with function name.

## 12) Constroctors in java
- Constructor is a type of method which is created at the time of object creation.
- Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
- It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
- There are two types of constructors in Java: no-arg constructor, and parameterized constructor.
- It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation.
- https://www.javatpoint.com/java-constructor

## 13) What is the purpose of a default constructor?
- The default constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc., depending on the type.
## 14) Why use the parameterized constructor?
- The parameterized constructor is used to provide different values to distinct objects. However, you can provide the same values also.

## 15) Constructor Overloading in Java?
- Same name but different parameter.
- Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. 
- They are arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task. 
-   They are differentiated by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

## 16) can we have more than one constructor in a class
- Yes, a class can have multiple constructors. These constructors can have different parameters, allowing for multiple ways to initialize an object of the class. They are often called "overloaded constructors."

## 17) Destroctor
- It is a special method that automatically gets called when an object is no longer used.
- In Java, when we create an object of the class it occupies some space in the memory (heap). If we do not delete these objects, it remains in the memory and occupies unnecessary space. To resolve this problem, we use the destructor.
- The destructor is the opposite of the constructor.
- there is no concept of destructor in Java. In place of the destructor, Java provides the garbage collector that works the same as the destructor.
- The Java Object class provides the finalize() method that works the same as the destructor

## 18) OBJECT vs CLASS

## 19) Real World analog of object and class

## 20) Static Keyword
- The static keyword belongs to the class than an instance of the class.
- The static keyword in Java is used for memory management mainly.
- The static can be:
    1) Variable (also known as a class variable)
    2) Method (also known as a class method)
    3) Block
    4) Nested class
- static methods can be called without creating an object of the class.
- A static variable is one that's associated with a class, not instance (object) of that class.
- They are initialized only once , at the start of the execution .

# 21)What are virtual keywords?

- The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class.

- The virtual keyword is not used in Java.

# [why virtual keyword is used](https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/270054/why-virtual-keyword-is-used)

- Marking a method as virtual means you can override it in derived classes, but you don't have to.
-  If you mark a method as abstract, you are subsequently forced by the compiler to override it in any derived classes.

## 22) Abstract Keyword
- The abstract keyword is used to achieve abstraction in Java. 
- 'abstract' keyword is used to declare the method or a class as abstract.
- - Abstract classes may or may not contain abstract methods, i.e., methods without a body ( public void get(); )
- But, if a class has at least one abstract method, then the class must be declared abstract.
- *If a class is declared abstract, it cannot be instantiated.*
- To use an abstract class, you have to inherit it from another class, provide implementations for the abstract methods in it.
- If you inherit an abstract class, you have to provide implementations to all the abstract methods in it.

- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/abstract-keyword-in-Java

## 23) Final keyword
- The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user.
- Final can be:
    - variable
    - method
    - class
- If we declare a variable as final then we can not change the value of it.
- If we declare a method as final then we can not override it.
- If we declare a class as final then we can not inherit it.

- https://www.javatpoint.com/final-keyword

## 24) explicit keyword

- Explicit Keyword in C++ is used to mark constructors to not implicitly convert types in C++. It is optional for constructors that take exactly one argument and work on constructors(with a single argument) since those are the only constructors that can be used in typecasting.

## 25) this keyword
- In Java, this is a reference variable that refers to the current object.

## 26) new keyword
- It is used to create the object.
- It allocates the memory at runtime.
- All objects occupy memory in the heap area.
- https://www.javatpoint.com/new-keyword-in-java

## 27) const keyword
- there is no concept of const keyword in java.
- **why**     Java allows us to declare constants by using final keyword.

## 28) super keyword
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102239780/214587213-2d51e623-d924-4304-8650-ac65b22ff352.png)

# Polymorphism

## 1) What is Polymorphism 
- it is a combinaton of 2 towd Poly and morphism 
- Poly means :- many  and morphism :- forms = manyforms
- whose meaning is **Same object having different behavior**
- example- let us consider i am an object. In my home, office and friend circle i act as different. Here object is same that is I but behaviour is different. This is a real time example of polymerphysm.

- **NEED** (allows us to reuse code by creating one function that's usable for multiple uses.)
- https://www.javatpoint.com/runtime-polymorphism-in-java


## 2) Overloading
- https://www.javatpoint.com/method-overloading-in-java
- Method overloading is used for compiletime polymorphism
- If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method Overloading.

## 3) Overriding
- https://www.javatpoint.com/method-overriding-in-java
- If subclass (child class) has the same method as declared in the parent class, it is known as method overriding in Java.
- Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass.
- Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism
## 4) Compile time polymerphism
- Compile-time polymorphism is obtained through method overloading. The term method overloading allows us to have more than one method with the same name. Since this process is executed during compile time, that's why it is known as Compile-Time Polymorphism.
- https://www.dineshonjava.com/compile-time-polymorphism-in-java/


## 5) Operators that cannot be overloaded in C++
- In C++ we can overload some operators like +, -, [], -> etc. But we cannot overload any operators in it. Some of the operators cannot be overloaded. These operators are like below

    - ? “.” Member access or dot operator
    - ? “? : ” Ternary or conditional operator
    - ? “::” Scope resolution operator
    - ? “.*” Pointer to member operator
    - ? “sizeof” The object size operator
    - ? “typeid” Object type operator
- These operators cannot be overloaded because if we overload them it will make serious programming issues.

- For an example the sizeof operator returns the size of the object or datatype as an operand. This is evaluated by the compiler. It cannot be evaluated during runtime. So we cannot overload it.


## 6)Functions that cannot be overloaded in C++
1) Function declarations that differ only in the return type.
2) Member function declarations with the same name and the name parameter-type-list cannot be overloaded if any of them is a static member function declaration.
3) Parameter declarations that differ only in a pointer * versus an array [] are equivalent.
4) Parameter declarations that differ only in that one is a function type and the other is a pointer to the same function type are equivalent. 
5) Parameter declarations that differ only in the presence or absence of const and/or volatile are equivalent. That is, the const and volatile type-specifiers for each parameter type are ignored when determining which function is being declared, defined, or called.
